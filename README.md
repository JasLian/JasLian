### Hello Hello Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jason and I'm currently an undergraduate CS student here at UIC. As a person who loves dealing with math, programming has given me the same headaches as math problems. However it has also given me that same joy in tackling and solving problems. I've been coding for over 4 years, starting in high school ever since some friends wanted to show me something cool they made. Since then, I have worked in Python, moved onto C++ and C, and is now diving head first into Java. I look forward to bring my skills in creating unique, challenging apps and software.
